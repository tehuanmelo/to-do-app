# ToDo App

This project is a simple To-Do application designed to sharpen my JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are stored in the browser's LocalStorage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the app [here](https://tehuanmelo.github.io/to-do-app/).
